# whatsnext

This is a small program that looks at your github repositories and
collects all open issues. If you're like me and have way too many
projects this is a really easy way to quickly see what needs attention.

I have spent absolutely no time on making this well factored or
tested. It was simply a quick and dirty hack to figure out things that
I may have let languish.

## Installation

This project is written in go. You will need to have a working go
environment in order to install it. You will also need the following
dependencies:

* `github.com/google/go-github/github`
* `golang.org/x/oauth2`
* `gopkg.in/yaml.v2`

If you have a working go environment you can install whatsnext using the following command:

```
$ go get github.com/abedra/whatsnext
```

You can also clone this repository and run the code directly.

## Setup

You will need to supply a yaml file to the program in order for it to
work correctly. The following example shows what is necessary:

```yaml
users:
  - abedra
  - repsheet
token: thisisnotatoken
```

In the users section you can provide any number of users or
organizations. The program will look for issues in any supplied
user. The token is for a github access token. Make sure the token you
generate can access the repositories you would like to examine.

## Contributing

Pull requests always welcome.
